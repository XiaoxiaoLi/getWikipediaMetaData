getWikipediaMetaDataWithRedirection
====================

Should be fairly similar to the Master branch. 

Main difference withe the Master branch is at the preprocessing of the wiki dump part. This branch includes the wikipedia <i>redirection</i> pages. We set the categories of the redirection pages to be the categories they redirect to.

This branch only cares about categories, not titles.
